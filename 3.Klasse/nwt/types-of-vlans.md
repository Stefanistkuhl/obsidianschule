- Default VLAN 
	- Vlan 1 is the following:
	- The defeault Vlan 
	- the default Native Vlan 
	- The default Managment VLAN 
	- Cannont be deleted or renamed 

- Data VLAN 
	- Dedicateed to user-generated traffic (email and web trafic)
	- VLAN 1 is the default datra VLAN because all interfaces are assigned to this VLAN
- Native VLAN
	- This is used for trunk links only. 
	- All frames are tagged on an 802.1Q trunk link except for those on the native VLAN.
- Managment VLAN 
	- This is used for SSH/Telnet VTY traffic and should not be carried with end user traffic 
	- Typically, the VLAN that is the SVI for the Layer 2 switch
	- if you have a data and a voice vlan the ip phone will pick the voice vlan bc it can handle tagged packets if you plug a pc into the same ports it will use the native vlan bc its untagged traffic on a trunk connection [mehr info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-default-vlan-and-native-vlan/)
- Voice VLAn 
	- A seperate VLAN is required because Voice traffic requires:
		- Assured bandwith 
		- High QoS (Quality of Service) priority 
		- Ability to avoid congestion 
		- Delay lesss that 150ms from source to destination
		- The entire network must be designed to support voice
