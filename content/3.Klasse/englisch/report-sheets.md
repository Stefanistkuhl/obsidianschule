1. **"Pinpoint the Trends of Tablet Market Shares"** → **"Analyze the Trends in Tablet Market Shares"**
    - **Reason:** "Pinpoint" is not the best verb in this context. "Analyze" is more appropriate for a report.
2. **"within the years 2010, 2011 and 2012"** → **"between the years 2010 and 2012"**
    - **Reason:** "Within the years" is incorrect; "between" is the proper preposition when referring to a range of years.
3. **"it’s easier to use and it’s more compact"** → **"it is easier to use and more compact"**
    - **Reason:** Contractions ("it’s") should not be used in formal reports. Also, "it is" does not need to be repeated.
4. **"you can use it at most places."** → **"it can be used in most places."**
    - **Reason:** More formal and impersonal phrasing is better for reports.
5. **"market share was mainly consisting of"** → **"market share mainly consisted of"**
    - **Reason:** "Was mainly consisting of" is grammatically incorrect. "Mainly consisted of" is the correct past tense form.
6. **"Apple had 82% Market Share, Samsung 11% and PC OEMs had 1% the other 6% where shared by unfamiliar brands."**  
    → **"Apple had 82% market share, Samsung had 11%, and PC OEMs had 1%. The remaining 6% was shared by unfamiliar brands."**
    
    - **Reason:** The original sentence has incorrect capitalization, a missing verb, and improper use of "where" (should be "was").
7. **"A year later in 2011 the market share from Apple and Samsung went down to 65% and 8%"**  
    → **"A year later, in 2011, Apple’s market share declined to 65%, and Samsung’s decreased to 8%."**
    - **Reason:** "Market share from Apple and Samsung" is awkward. "Declined" and "decreased" are better verbs for data trends.
8. **"The only brand that didn’t change was Nokia, still sharing 0% of the market."**  
    → **"The only brand that did not change was Nokia, which continued to have 0% market share."**
    
    - **Reason:** "Didn’t" should be changed to "did not" for formality. "Sharing 0% of the market" is awkward; "continued to have 0% market share" is clearer.
9. **"In 2012 Apple shrunk by 8%"** → **"In 2012, Apple’s market share decreased by 8%"**
    - **Reason:** "Shrunk" is informal; "decreased" is more appropriate for a report.
10. **"Overall, the tiny brands increased in market share."** → **"Overall, smaller brands gained market share."**
- **Reason:** "Tiny brands" is too informal; "smaller brands" is more professional. "Gained market share" is more precise.
11. **"it would be the best to focus on Apple and Samsung"** → **"it would be best to focus on Apple and Samsung"**
	- **Reason:** "The best" is incorrect here; "best" alone fits better.
12. **"as the market share of rather smaller brands might rise over the years."**  
    → **"as the market share of smaller brands may increase over time."**
	- **Reason:** "Rather smaller brands" is unnatural. "May increase over time" is more formal and clear.

13. **"tables"** → **"tablets"**  
   - **Original:** "The main reason why people prefer tables to PCs and laptops..."  
   - **Correction:** "The main reason why people prefer **tablets** to PCs and laptops..."  
   - **Reason:** "Tables" is incorrect; the intended word is "tablets."  

2. **"Tables have also a longer battery life than laptops."** → **"Tablets also have a longer battery life than laptops."**  
   - **Reason:** Incorrect word order; "also" should come before "have" for proper sentence structure.  

3. **"percent"** → **"%** (for consistency)  
   - **Original:** "82 percent of customers bought Apple tablets and 11 percent bought Samsung tablets."  
   - **Correction:** "82% of customers bought Apple tablets and 11% bought Samsung tablets."  
   - **Reason:** While "percent" is not necessarily wrong, using "%" is more consistent with numerical data presentation in reports.  

4. **"To have a variety of tablets is important"** → **"Having a variety of tablets is important"**  
   - **Reason:** The original phrase is grammatically awkward. Using a gerund ("Having") makes the sentence more natural.  

5. **"its good"** → **"it is good"**  
   - **Original:** "...so its good to have other cheaper brands in stock."  
   - **Correction:** "...so **it is** good to have other, cheaper brands in stock."  
   - **Reason:** "its" (possessive) should be "it is" (contraction not used in formal reports).  

6. **"prices classes"** → **"price classes"**  
   - **Original:** "...so its important to have a variety of tablets."  
   - **Correction:** "...so **it is** important to have a variety of tablets."  
   - **Reason:** "prices classes" is incorrect; "price classes" is the correct term. Also, "its" should be changed to "it is" for formality.
