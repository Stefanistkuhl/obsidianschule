Addiction amongst youth and what we can do about it!

Hi everyone!
Today I want to write about addiction amongst young people. A statistic from PKA Research from 2019 inspired me to pick up this topic. As I am young myself, I felt the need to write about this.

First of all, let's break down their findings: The main results from the bar chart show that by far marijuana is the most common addiction amongst UK youth, followed by alcohol and prescription drugs.

Now, you might ask yourself how addictions can affect the lives of young people. Most effects can be categorized into physical and social issues. Physical issues are for example the damage to your liver that is caused by alcohol consumption. Arguing with your friends and family would be an example for a social issue.

Let's think about what schools can do to prevent this. In my opinion pupils should be educated about the risks of consuming drugs. Furthermore, if they plan to try them anyway,schools should provide information on how they can do that in a safe and controlled environment. 

What do you think about that? If you have any more thoughts about it, feel free to leave a comment and join the discussion down below.

Thanks for brining up the topic, Kantar! I have read your post about Gen Z and I mostly agree with you. 

To begin with, I agree that Gen Z is more money conscious. This is shown through product reviews, which previously either didn't exist or were very hard to find. However, I find it very concerning that we favour renting over owning, which has led to the plague of needing a subscription for everything online.

Stigma is one of the most difficult parts of growing up in today's society. Since our society and especially the way we think about education paths have changed drastically, which furthermore has led to a confrontation of vastly different world views and thus makes it more difficult <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">to talk about such topics with people from older generations.</mark> (oarsch satz aba fine ig)

Lastly, I want to outline the improvements that I would like to see in our society. The most important one is that we drop our prejudices and destigmatize topics such as education. But I am positive that will change, as the older generations will be replaced and as soon as Gen Z's replace Millennials, there will be a new problem, which will be solved by the next generation and that this cycle will go on.

What do you think about it? I am looking forward to discuss this further.
